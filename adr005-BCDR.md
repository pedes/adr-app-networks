## 5. Disaster Recovery Strategy
Outline the strategies for recovering from a disaster that significantly impacts your REST APIs and AWS infrastructure. Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for critical systems. Describe the backup and restore processes, infrastructure provisioning, and data recovery procedures.

## 6. BCDR Plan Implementation
Provide step-by-step instructions for implementing the BCDR plan. Include the necessary configurations, scripts, and procedures to ensure a smooth execution during a crisis. Define the roles and responsibilities of the individuals involved.

## 7. Testing and Maintenance
Detail the procedures for regularly testing the BCDR plan to validate its effectiveness. Specify the testing frequency and methods. Document the process for incorporating lessons learned and making necessary improvements.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

## 10. Training and Awareness
Describe the training programs and awareness campaigns to educate employees about their roles, responsibilities, and procedures outlined in the BCDR plan. Include periodic refresher training and updates.

## 11. Plan Review and Update
Establish a schedule for reviewing and updating the BCDR plan. Specify the process for incorporating changes based on organizational, operational, or technological modifications. Assign responsible individuals for plan maintenance.

## 12. Appendix
