# ADR: Monitoring Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As part of our software system's architecture, it is crucial to establish a robust monitoring strategy to ensure the health, performance, and availability of our application. To achieve this, we need to identify and measure key metrics and KPIs that will provide meaningful insights into the system's behavior and performance.

## Decision
We have decided to monitor the following metrics and KPIs:

1. Response Time:
   - Average response time: Measures the average time taken by the system to respond to requests.
   - Percentile response time (e.g., 95th percentile): Captures the response time experienced by a significant majority of users, highlighting outliers and potential performance issues.

2. Error Rates:
   - HTTP error rates (4xx and 5xx): Tracks the frequency of client and server errors, indicating potential issues with functionality, performance, or user experience.
   - Application-specific error rates: Monitors the occurrence of specific application-level errors or exceptions that can impact system stability and user satisfaction.

3. Availability and Uptime:
   - System uptime: Measures the percentage of time the system remains operational and accessible.
   - Downtime duration: Tracks the duration and frequency of system outages, highlighting areas that require improvement in terms of fault tolerance and resilience.

4. Throughput and Load:
   - Request throughput: Measures the number of requests processed per unit of time, indicating the system's capacity to handle incoming traffic.
   - Concurrent user sessions: Tracks the number of active user sessions to assess system load and capacity requirements.

5. Resource Utilization:
   - CPU and Memory usage: Monitors the utilization of CPU and memory resources, identifying potential performance bottlenecks and scalability concerns.
   - Disk space utilization: Tracks the amount of disk space consumed, ensuring that sufficient storage is available for logs, data, and system operations.

6. Security and Compliance:
   - Security events and anomalies: Monitors security-related events, such as unauthorized access attempts, suspicious activities, or breaches, ensuring the integrity and safety of the system.
   - Compliance adherence: Tracks adherence to regulatory or internal compliance requirements, such as data protection or privacy standards.

## Rationale
The decision to monitor these metrics and KPIs is based on the following reasons:

1. Performance Optimization: Monitoring response time, error rates, and throughput helps identify performance bottlenecks, allowing architects and developers to optimize the system and enhance user experience.

2. Proactive Issue Detection: Tracking error rates, uptime, and security events enables the early detection of issues, facilitating prompt resolution and minimizing potential disruptions.

3. Capacity Planning: Monitoring resource utilization and concurrent user sessions provides insights into system capacity requirements, ensuring appropriate scaling and resource allocation.

4. Compliance and Security: Monitoring security events and compliance adherence helps maintain the system's integrity, protect sensitive data, and meet regulatory requirements.

## Consequences
The monitoring of these metrics and KPIs will enable us to:

- Identify and address performance issues, ensuring optimal system responsiveness.
- Detect and resolve errors or anomalies promptly, minimizing their impact on users.
- Plan and scale the system effectively, based on resource utilization and demand patterns.
- Enhance security and compliance measures, protecting sensitive data and meeting regulatory obligations.

However, it is essential to consider the associated costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing and maintaining an effective monitoring solution.
