# API Versioning using URI Params

## Status

Accepted

## Context

APIs are subject to change, and is needed a mechanism to support these changes without breaking the connectivity/integration from the clients.

One strategy to solve this problem is by providing the version on the URL, e.g. /api/v1/customers

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
